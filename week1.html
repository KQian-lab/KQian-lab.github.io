<p><ul>What did you do last week?</ul>
    <p>Last week, I setup my files for sentiment analysis. I connected my script to the reddit api and collected data from the wallstreetbets subreddit. I wrote this data to a csv file to perform sentiment analysis on. Additionally, I created my personal site to log my project progress.</p>
    <ul>What do you plan to do this week?</ul>
    <p>This week I plan on setting up the automatic data cleaning process, so I can utilize nltk to perform sentiment analysis. Additionally, I will manually adjust the nltk coefficients based on specific emojis or words that are present in post titles that nltk may not pick up. I also plan to perform research on the sms api necessary for sending notifications.</p>
    <ul>Are there any impediments in your way?</ul>
    <p>Currently there is  nothing impeding my progress</p>
    <ul>How can you make the process work better?</ul>
    <p>I believe my process could work better if I thought about potential roadblocks early on. This way I can try to tailor my work to avoid issues or roadblocks.</p>
