<p><ul>What did you do last week?</ul>
    <p>Last week I worked on implementing the texting API for sending notifications to the given phone number.</p>
    <ul>What do you plan to do this week?</ul>
    <p>This week I plan to explore the chatGPT API more and see if I can use the information from my sentiment analysis to create a more readable 'daily roundup'.</p>
    <ul>Are there any impediments in your way?</ul>
    <p>The only potential roadblock I see will be with the chatGPT API since I have not worked with it before I may run into some difficulty.</p>
    <ul>How can you make the process work better?</ul>
    <p>I believe as long as I keep spending time working on this project it should turn out better. I think I will be able to figure out the API as long as I start early.</p>
