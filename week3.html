<p><ul>What did you do last week?</ul>
    <p>Last week I did research on working with the chatGPT API. I also finished setting up the texting features of my program.</p>
    <ul>What do you plan to do this week?</ul>
    <p>This week I plan to integrate the chatGPT API into my project. </p>
    <ul>Are there any impediments in your way?</ul>
    <p>I ran into a roadblock with the texting APIs, they all charged money and the free options did not work. I was  able to find a python package that utilized a different service to allow me to send text messages.</p>
    <ul>How can you make the process work better?</ul>
    <p>Doing research in advance, would  have helped me avoid issues regarding APIs. I believe this week I researched enough of the chatGPT api to make it work more easily.</p>
